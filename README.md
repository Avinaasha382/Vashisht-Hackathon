# Virtual Legal Assistant @VASHISHT HACKATHON

## üìå Project Overview

The **Virtual Legal Assistant** is a web-based legal assistant that helps users:

- Ask legal questions and get AI-generated answers (Q/A mode)
- Search for relevant legal cases (Search Cases mode)
- Upload a document and get AI-generated responses based on its content (Document Answering mode)
- **Multilingual Support**!!! Not Comfortable with English, Dont Worry we got you with multilingual support in thousands of languages

The frontend is built with **HTML, JavaScript, and CSS**, while the backend is powered by **Flask, Sentence Transformers, Facebook Bart** for AI-driven responses.

## üîß Technologies Used

### **Frontend**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Fetch API for sending requests to backend

### **Backend**

- Python (Flask for API)
- Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- BART Model for RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tasks (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`)
- Google Translator API (for multilingual support)
- Sklearn (Cosine Similarity for question matching)
- Thresholding for prevention of garbage values.
- Numpy & JSON for data handling
- Using **Regex** and **NLP** for creating and curating a custom dataset that acts as an header to the original Database
- Using Torch and Sentence Transformers a fine tuned model was created with embeddings saved in qa_model for fast fetching

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/APillai03/Vashisht-Hackathon
cd Vashisht-Hackathon
```
### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Database.zip**
```bash
tar -xf "backend\Database.zip" -C "backend"
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Backend (Flask API)**

#### **üîπ Install Python Dependencies**

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv env1   # Create a virtual environment
source env1/bin/activate  # (For macOS/Linux)
env1\Scripts\activate  # (For Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
```


#### **üîπ Start the Flask Server**

```bash
python backend.py
```

The API will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Frontend**

No Hassle with React No TS no Tailwind No dependencies required! Just open `frontend/index.html` in a browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Q/A Mode** (Ask legal questions)

```http
POST /api/qa
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "question": "What are the rights of citizenship for certain persons of Indian origin residing outside India?"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "answer": "Any person who or either of whose parents or any of whose grand-parents was born in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935, and who is ordinarily residing in any country outside India as so defined shall be deemed to be a citizen of India if he has been registered as a citizen of India by the diplomatic or consular representative of India in the country where he is residing."
}
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Search Cases Mode** (Legal case search)

```http
POST /api/search
```

Similar to Q/A mode but searches in legal case data.
- This feature was implemented by using data reduction from case_files to Header by using NLP and regex model to extract usable data; 
- Then binary search is performed on the names of the cases. The output is the metadata of that particular case and follwed by it is a download case button; 
- Which will serve the actual case file as dictated by the presiding Judge. 

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Document Answering Mode** (Upload document & get answers)

```http
POST /api/document
```

**Request Body:** FormData with request as a `file`. 
- The backend uses a finetuned Facebook Bart model to summarize the given document;
- Saving the hassle to go through thousands of lines of case files

---

## üìå How it Works

1. User selects a mode (`Q/A`, `Search Cases`, or `Document Answering`).
2. Inputs a legal query or uploads a document.
3. The frontend sends a request to the backend.
4. The backend processes the request using **Sentence Transformers** and **Cosine Similarity**.
5. Response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## üõ† Future Enhancements

- Improve response accuracy using **fine-tuned legal datasets**.
- Add **OCR support** for extracting text from images.
- Integrate **speech-to-text** for voice-based input.
- Add a functionality to understand the context of Users Case and go through millions of Cases and suggest a better outcome
